- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexnils. I'm a full stack developer and linguist.
- 👀 I’m interested in React.js, Next.js, and full stack development (MERN and ASP.NET Core) in general. The languages I'm most proficient in are C#, JavaScript and Python.
- 🌱 I’ve previously learned how to build a [blog](https://alexnils.com) from scratch (i.e. setting up a VPS, installing `nginx`, deploying the production build) using Next.js. I've also dabbled some with building a [Chrome-extension](https://github.com/alexnils/hayyim-dictionary-lookup) using vanilla JavaScript and a [Telegram bot](https://github.com/alexnils/HayyimBot) in Python. I've also built [a simple web app](https://github.com/alexnils/TranscribersMvc) in C# for transcribing between Tajik and Uzbek in Cyrillic into Latin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is fun and a learning experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: I used the `nodemailer` package to write some back-end code that sends me an e-mail whenever anyone submits this [form](https://alexnils.com/contact). Go and check it out!
